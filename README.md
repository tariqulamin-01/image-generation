## Overview
This project utilizes **DreamShaper-7**, a powerful AI model for generating high-quality images from text prompts. The model is based on Stable Diffusion and fine-tuned for artistic and realistic outputs.

## Features
- Generate stunning images from textual descriptions
- Support for different styles and resolutions
- Customizable parameters for fine-tuned output
- Easy integration into existing AI workflows

## Installation
